# Self-hosted Bitwarden instance

* Documentation: https://bitwarden.com/help/self-host-an-organization/ and https://bitwarden.com/help/install-and-deploy-unified-beta/
* Works extremely unstable with MySQL database as the backend! Use Postgresql!


# TODO

* Logs collection -> move to alloy
* Metrics + Graphana Dashboard
* R/O filesystem
* Make it run not from root (own Dockerfile?)
